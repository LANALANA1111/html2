        Manga and anime are perhaps Japan's biggestcultural export – and they make
        <br>
        up one of the most recognizable art styles on the planet.
        <br>
        Since the nineties, when everyone in the western world was suddenly
        <br>
        talking about Pokémon, Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Dragon Ball Z, anime has
        <br>
        become something of a household term. Something completely associated with
        <br>
        Japan and something that has become one of the biggest cultural trends among 
        <br>
        children and young adults ever since.Yet, the world of Japanese anime is
        <br>
        a lot more varied and complex than we in the west might realize. 'Anime' only in 
        <br>
        the west refers to Japanese animation as a whole. In Japanese culture, anime is actually 
        <br>
        a term for any mass-produced animation, Japanese or non-Japanese.
        <br>
        And, importantly, in Japan, anime is not just culture for kids. Rather,
        <br>
        anime series like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Attack on Titan, Death Note,
        <br> 
        and Cowboy Bebop were all hugely successful amongst adults too. Indeed, many of these 
        <br>
        series were actually intended for adults – developing complex themes and plotlines and
        <br>
        presenting three-dimensional and realistic characters.
        <br>
        This is the beauty of anime. It can range from the shoujo anime 
        <br>
        shows such as the 'magical girl' series like Cardcaptor Sakura to the poetic and haunting 
        <br>
        anime movies like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke.
        <br>
        It's an incredibly rich culture – so let's take a dive in.

       Why Is Anime So Popular In Japan?
    </h1>
    <img src="./images/2 photo.jpg" style="width: 300px;" alt="japanese street">
    <p style="color: deeppink;background-color: black;">
        In the west, we associate anime with Japan and – almost – Japan with anime.
        <br> 
        It's a massive part of their cultural industry – and is perhaps the country's 
        <br>
        third-largest industry. This makesit, obviously, pretty mega, bringing in nearly
        <br>
        twenty billion dollars a year.
        <br>
        Yet, the success of anime across the world is one of the most amazing things
        <br> 
        about this genre. Apparently, sixty percent of all animated television shows across the world
        <br> 
        come from Japan. The anime industry in China is absolutely huge, whilst, in the west, various 
        <br>
        channels and services distributing anime have made it even more popular.
        <br>
        Over the years, channels like Cartoon Network – with Adult Swim and Toonami – and
        <br>
        now anime streaming sites such as Crunchyroll and Funimation have brought this medium
        <br>
        to an ever-growing audience. These days, over one hundred thousand people attend America's 
        <br>
        annual anime convention.

        Anime In Japanese Culture?

    <p style="color: deeppink;background-color: black;">
        Yet, so the history goes, Japanese anime was originally marketed incredibly
        <br>
        aggressively to a global audience – precisely because there weren't enough anime fans in Japan. 
        <br>
        But, now, anime is pretty much everywhere in that country. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, six
        <br>
        of the ten highest-grossing movies were anime, whilst Spirited Away remains the biggest-selling 
        <br>
        film in Japan. Seventy percent of Japanese DVD sales are also anime.
        <br>
        Anime is visible everywhere. In adverts, in branding for water and snacks, on trains,
        <br>
        school buses, and in airports. It has become a ubiquitous cultural force that has come to define
        <br>
        the country itself.Yet, it goes without saying that not everyone likes it. And, even in the world
        <br>
        of anime, many people are concerned about the commercialization of the form. With every successful
        <br>
        anime undergoing adaptation into a light novel, a live-action film, video games, merchandise, music,
        <br>
        and manga, the industry is sort of all-encompassing.In the same way that Disney makes a lot of the
        <br>
        products that it sells alongside the films themselves – there is a Pokémon theme park just as there
        <br>
        is a Disneyland – anime does the same.And I'm sure you'll agree that not everyone likes Disney.Find
        <br>

        Which Are Japan's Most Popular Anime?
    </h1>
       <img src="./images/4 photo.jpg" style="width: 300px;" alt="anime">
    <p style="color: deeppink;background-color: black;">
        Identifying the best anime or even the most popular anime series is a difficult task.
        <br>
        This is because there are anime for young girls (known as shoujo anime), anime for
        <br>
        teenage guys (shounen anime), and anime also for adults.This is the key to the success
        <br>
        of the anime industry in Japan. But it also warns against treatinganime like a monolithic
        <br>
        thing.However, some anime are easy to point at and identify as extremely popular. Take the
        <br>
        films of Studio Ghibli – Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away ­– which each, in turn, was the
        <br> 
        highest-grossing anime film ever. Kimi No Na Wa is the highest-grossing anime film of all time;
        <br>
        however, Spirited Away still remains the only anime movie to have won an Academy Award.
